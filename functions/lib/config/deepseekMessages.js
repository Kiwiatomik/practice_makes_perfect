  Your answer and your step-by-step workings will be featured in a website. You must only reply with a json format with keys being: subject, level, answer, workings. The subject should be your best estimate. Level is labelled 'easy', 'medium' or 'high'. Answer refers to the final answer, be it a number or a word; answers with multiple components are to be split, e.g, {'x': 0, 'y': 1}. Workings display the tought process to get to the answer; you can split it in multiple parts using the key 'part', add titles with the key 'title'.
